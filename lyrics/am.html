      Survivor
    </p>

    <p>
      I got my bad shades on<br>
      Jet-black am in ma zone<br>
      I'm sick of the news<br>
      I'm sick of the views<br>
      I'm sick of the lies they've told
    </p>

    <p>
      Come on and shine the light<br>
      Come on and shine on me<br>
      Guess you can see<br>
      I don't believe<br>
      Anything they told me
    </p>

    <p>
      Letting me down<br>
      Lifting me up<br>
      Keeping me slow<br>
      But I can't stop<br>
      It's tearing me apart<br>
      I'm alive<br>
      Tryna look up, atop of a rock<br>
      Climbing these heights, man<br>
      I can't stop at all<br>
      I'm standing tall
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a survivor<br>
      Stay aliver<br>
      Do or die in my prime<br>
      I'm a fighter<br>
      I'm a survivor<br>
      Won't be tied up<br>
      Break from the pain<br>
      Take your place, I'll remind ya
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a survivor
    </p>

    <p>
      Break from the pain<br>
      Take your place, I'll remind ya
    </p>

    <p>
      Kicking me, breaking me<br>
      But I won't stop<br>
      Pushing me, pulling me<br>
      I will get up<br>
      Hitting me, mocking me<br>
      Stabbing me, crushing me<br>
      Tearing me, burning me<br>
      I'll never stop
    </p>

    <p>
      I could have lost my way<br>
      I could have made mistakes<br>
      I bled a lot, more than you thought<br>
      But I didn't fade away
    </p>

    <p>
      Say you'll break me down<br>
      And bring me to my knees<br>
      You can do it<br>
      Can you prove it?<br>
      But you ain't got shit on me
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a survivor<br>
      Break from the pain<br>
      Take your place, I'll remind ya
    </p>

    <p>
      Breathe in breathe out it's all done<br>
      Never forget who you are<br>
      Breathe in breathe out it's all done<br>
      Never forget who you are
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a survivor<br>
      Stay aliver<br>
      Do or die in my prime<br>
      I'm a fighter<br>
      I'm a survivor<br>
      Won't be tied up<br>
      Break from the pain<br>
      Take your place, I'll remind ya
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a survivor<br>
      I'm a survivor
    </p>

    <p>
      Break from the pain<br>
      Take your place<br>
      Survivor<br>
      Break from the pain<br>
      Take your place<br>
      Survivor<br>
      Break from the pain<br>
      Take your place
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm a survivor
