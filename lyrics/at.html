    <p>
      I'm an ocean of love<br>
      And you're scared of water<br>
      You don't want to go under<br>
      So you let me go under<br>
      I reach out my hand<br>
      But you watch me grow distant<br>
      Drift out to the sea<br>
      And far away in an instant
    </p>

    <p>
      You left me in the deep end<br>
      I'm drowning in my feelings<br>
      How do you not see that?
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that you're gone<br>
      All I have is wasted love<br>
      This wasted love<br>
      Now that you're gone<br>
      Can't fill my heart with wasted love<br>
      This wasted love
    </p>

    <p>
      When you let me go<br>
      I barely stayed afloat<br>
      I'm floating all alone<br>
      Still I'm holding on to hope
    </p>

    <p>
      Now that you're gone<br>
      All I have is wasted love<br>
      This wasted love<br>
      Now that you're gone<br>
      Can't fill my heart with wasted love<br>
      This wasted love
    </p>

    <p>
      Wasted love<br>
      This wasted love<br>
      (Wasted, wasted, wasted…)<br>
      Wasted love
    </p>
