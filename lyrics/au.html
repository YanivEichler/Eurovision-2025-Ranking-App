    <p>
      Come and take a sip from my special cup<br>
      I heard that you could use a little pick me up<br>
      What can get you high when you're oh so sad?<br>
      It's the milk from the milkshake man
    </p>

    <p>
      (Ah-ah-ah)<br>
      Well I've got chocolate, vanilla, and lactose free<br>
      (Ah-ah-ah)<br>
      And a caramel banana, that you have got to see
    </p>

    <p>
      You can call me the milkshake man<br>
      I wanna shake and make the whole world dance<br>
      They drink my milk all across the land<br>
      I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man
    </p>

    <p>
      (Sh-sh-shake me good, sh-sh-shake me good)<br>
      I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man<br>
      (Sh-sh-shake me good, sh-sh-shake me good)<br>
      I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man
    </p>

    <p>
      The shake is not a drink - it's a state of mind<br>
      Like a secret super power you were born to find<br>
      Drink it every day and before you know it<br>
      You'll be bigger… and stronger… with harder bones
    </p>

    <p>
      (Ah-ah-ah)<br>
      Well I've got mango, mojito, a fruit ballet<br>
      (Ah-ah-ah)<br>
      And did you see the naughty special on my crème brûlée?
    </p>

    <p>
      You can call me the milkshake man<br>
      I wanna shake up all the milk I can<br>
      They know my name all across the land<br>
      I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man
    </p>

    <p>
      (Sh-sh-shake me good, sh-sh-shake me good)<br>
      I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man<br>
      (Sh-sh-shake me good, sh-sh-shake me good)<br>
      I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man
    </p>

    <p>
      Excusez-moi monsieur, avez-vous du lait pour moi?<br>
      When I say sweet sweet, you say yum yum<br>
      Sweet, sweet (yum, yum)<br>
      Sweet, sweet (yum, yum)<br>
      When I say sweet sweet, you say yum yum<br>
      Sweet, sweet (yum, yum)<br>
      Sweet, sweet (yum, yum)
    </p>

    <p>
      (Sh-sh-shake me good, sh-sh-shake me good)<br>
      I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man<br>
      (Sh-sh-shake me good, sh-sh-shake me good)<br>
      I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man<br>
      (Sh-sh-shake me good, sh-sh-shake me good)<br>
      I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man<br>
      (Sh-sh-shake me good, sh-sh-shake me good)<br>
      I can tell you want a taste of the milkshake man
