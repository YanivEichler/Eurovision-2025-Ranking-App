    <p>
      Strobe lights, gettin' lost in your eyes<br>
      Cotton candy haze, we're floating round in space
    </p>

    <p>
      Fallin' where up is down<br>
      Screamin', but won't make a sound<br>
      Alice, show me your hand<br>
      Take it to Wonderland
    </p>

    <p>
      Step into the mirror to bright new dimensions<br>
      Where no words are needed to feel the connection<br>
      Where clocks never tick and where love is the ending<br>
      Come down through the looking glass
    </p>

    <p>
      Strobe lights, gettin' lost in your eyes<br>
      Cotton candy haze, we're floating round in space<br>
      Skin tight, never felt so alive<br>
      Caught up in this maze<br>
      It's where I wanna stay
    </p>

    <p>
      Flyin' deep underground<br>
      Silence never felt so loud
    </p>

    <p>
      Step into the mirror to bright new dimensions<br>
      Where no words are needed to feel the connection<br>
      Where clocks never tick and where love is the ending<br>
      Come down through the looking glass
    </p>

    <p>
      Strobe lights, gettin' lost in your eyes<br>
      Cotton candy haze, we're floating round in space<br>
      Skin tight, I feel so alive<br>
      Caught up in this maze<br>
      It's where I wanna stay
    </p>

    <p>
      That's where I wanna stay<br>
      That's where I wanna stay
    </p>
