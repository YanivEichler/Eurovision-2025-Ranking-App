    <p>
      I've got golden locks and eyes so captivating<br>
      I am famous for my beauty, who am I (Shh)<br>
      I've been told I'm a little overconfident<br>
      And this will be my downfall, who am I (Shh)
    </p>

    <p>
      I fell in deep<br>
      I lost my heartbeat<br>
      Stuck in between<br>
      The heaven and hell in me<br>
      I fell in deep<br>
      I lost my heartbeat<br>
      Follow the bloodstream
    </p>

    <p>
      Hush, hush<br>
      If you know my name then please don't repeat it<br>
      Hush, hush<br>
      If you know my name then keep it a secret
    </p>

    <p>
      In the ground<br>
      In the sky<br>
      In the afterlife<br>
      In the dark<br>
      In the light<br>
      In the sweet divine<br>
      Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush
    </p>

    <p>
      My desire and my love got me in trouble<br>
      I'm decay and I'm revival, who am I (Shh)<br>
      Grabbed by jealousy and cheated by my enemy<br>
      From tears and blood to flowers, who am I?
    </p>

    <p>
      I fell in deep<br>
      I lost my heartbeat<br>
      Stuck in between<br>
      The heaven and hell in me<br>
      I fell in deep<br>
      I lost my heartbeat<br>
      Follow the bloodstream
    </p>

    <p>
      Hush, hush<br>
      If you know my name then please don't repeat it<br>
      Hush, hush<br>
      If you know my name then keep it a secret
    </p>

    <p>
      In the ground<br>
      In the sky<br>
      In the afterlife<br>
      In the dark<br>
      In the light<br>
      In the sweet divine<br>
      Hush, hush, hush, hush, hush
    </p>

    <p>
      (If you know my name)<br>
      (You should know my name)<br>
      (If you know my name)
    </p>

    <p>
      Hush<br>
      (If you know my name)<br>
      (If you know my name)
    </p>

    <p>
      In the ground<br>
      In the sky<br>
      In the afterlife<br>
      In the dark<br>
      In the light<br>
      In the sweet divine<br>
      Hush, hush, hush, hush<br>
      (Shh)
    </p>
