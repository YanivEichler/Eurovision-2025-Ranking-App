    <p>
      Someone lost a shoe<br>
      I'm still in last night's makeup<br>
      I'm waking up like, "What's this new tattoo?"<br>
      Room is spinning, ears are ringing<br>
      Clutch my pearls like
    </p>

    <p>
      What the hell just happened?<br>
      What the hell just happened?<br>
      No clue, but I liked it
    </p>

    <p>
      (One, two, one, two, three)
    </p>

    <p>
      Broke a heel, lost my keys, scraped my knee<br>
      When I fell from the chandelier<br>
      Oh, what a night, I don't mind, it was time<br>
      To unwind and I volunteered<br>
      Look at me now<br>
      I'm like usually keep it clean<br>
      Beauty sleep, sip my tea
    </p>

    <p>
      What the hell just happened?<br>
      What the hell just happened?<br>
      Went up on the roof, jumped into the pool<br>
      You should do it too, too, too, too<br>
      What the hell just happened?<br>
      No clue, but I liked it
    </p>

    <p>
      Ripped my dress, called my ex, I confess<br>
      I'm obsessed, not the best idea<br>
      I'm a mess, it's a trend, in my defence<br>
      It's been a real hard year<br>
      Freedom, I wanna shave my head<br>
      Freedom, paint the whole town red<br>
      Freedom, I wanna kiss a stranger
    </p>

    <p>
      What the hell just happened?<br>
      What the hell just happened?
    </p>

    <p>
      What the hell just happened?<br>
      What the hell just happened?<br>
      Went up on the roof, jumped into the pool<br>
      You should do it too, too, too, too<br>
      I know that I'm a wreck, what did you expect?<br>
      You can blame my e-e-ex<br>
      What the hell just happened?<br>
      No clue, but I liked it
    </p>
