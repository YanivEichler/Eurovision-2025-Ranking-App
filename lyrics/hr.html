      It's cool now in the kitchen<br>
      That happens when you're bitten<br>
      I'm stirring and stirring<br>
      Deliciously pouring<br>
      And I know you're gonna love this<br>
      A better kind of justice<br>
      I don't want it burning
    </p>

    <p>
      One last thing, a sprinkle of my sweet revenge<br>
      One last thing, a sprinkle of my sweet revenge
    </p>

    <p>
      Made you something that I know you'll like<br>
      Chocolate-covered sugar and spice<br>
      Tasty, tasty, yum, yum, tasty<br>
      Candy colours oh so nice<br>
      Take a bite of my poison cake, yum
    </p>

    <p>
      Poison cake<br>
      Poison cake<br>
      Poison cake<br>
      Poison cake
    </p>

    <p>
      Take a bite of my poison cake<br>
      Been cooking in my cauldron late<br>
      You're never ever gonna stay awake<br>
      You're going down, down, down<br>
      You thought I was a servant slave<br>
      But I am just a serpent snake<br>
      You better genuflect and pray<br>
      You better genuflect and pray
    </p>

    <p>
      Tingles of poison are hitting your veins<br>
      "What have you done?"<br>
      Your words are slurring as you fall down
    </p>

    <p>
      One last thing, a sprinkle of my sweet revenge<br>
      One last thing, a sprinkle of my sweet revenge
    </p>

    <p>
      Made you something that I know you'll like<br>
      Chocolate-covered sugar and spice<br>
      Tasty, tasty, yum, yum, tasty<br>
      Candy colours oh so nice<br>
      Take a bite of my…
    </p>

    <p>
      Poison cake<br>
      Poison cake<br>
      Poison cake<br>
      Poison cake
    </p>

    <p>
      It's not my fault, I got carried away<br>
      I lost control when I started to bake<br>
      A dash of death is bitter to swallow<br>
      Don't be scared, you'll be buried tomorrow
    </p>

    <p>
      Poison<br>
      Poison cake<br>
      Poison cake<br>
      Poison cake<br>
      Poison cake<br>
      Poison cake<br>
      Poison cake<br>
      Poison cake<br>
      Poison cake
    </p>
