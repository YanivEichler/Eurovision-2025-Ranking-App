      I've got a secret you should know<br>
      Come a little close, I'll whisper slow<br>
      I've got a secret you should know<br>
      (Shhh shhh shhh shhh)
    </p>

    <p>
      People say "don't be so loud"<br>
      Watch the words coming out your mouth<br>
      Hands crossed, don't dare stand out<br>
      (Follow the crowd, follow the crowd)
    </p>

    <p>
      Pull up, pull up, make 'em all bow down<br>
      Shut up, shut up, I'ma be real loud<br>
      Get up, get up, I don't back down<br>
      (Follow me now, follow me now)
    </p>

    <p>
      Only lovers, no enemies<br>
      Feel it round me queen energy<br>
      In my power a higher me<br>
      Here's the secret remedy
    </p>

    <p>
      Why should we let other people decide<br>
      When we could be having the time of our lives<br>
      Let down your walls, come and dance to my vibe<br>
      I do it all the time<br>
      Yeah, I do it all the time
