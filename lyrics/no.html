    <p>
      Golden girl dressed in ice<br>
      A heart as dark as night<br>
      You got me to dim my light, no more<br>
      I really think I bought your lies<br>
      Did anything to keep you mine<br>
      You kept me hooked on your line, no more
    </p>

    <p>
      Somewhere along the way I lost my mind<br>
      I had to walk a hundred thousand miles<br>
      I'm not afraid to set it all on fire<br>
      I won't fall again<br>
      I'll be my own lighter
    </p>

    <p>
      Nothing can burn me now<br>
      I'll be my own lighter<br>
      I feel a spark inside me<br>
      I don't need saving<br>
      No way, no way<br>
      'Cause I'm my own<br>
      I'm my own lighter
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm tired of a million tries to fight, the signs<br>
      And when everybody tried to tell me<br>
      I should've known that it was time to break free<br>
      Your reigns that kept me at your mercy<br>
      I'll burn them to the ground<br>
      No more, no more<br>
      Ignite the fire
    </p>

    <p>
      Somewhere along the way I lost my mind<br>
      I had to walk a hundred thousand miles<br>
      I'm not afraid to set it all on fire<br>
      I won't fall again<br>
      I'll be my own lighter
    </p>

    <p>
      Nothing can burn me now<br>
      I'll be my own lighter<br>
      I feel a spark inside me<br>
      I don't need saving<br>
      No way, no way<br>
      'Cause I'm my own<br>
      I'm my own lighter
    </p>

    <p>
      Silence fills the room<br>
      And I've taken off my jewels<br>
      I wish none of this was true<br>
      But there's a fire growing too
    </p>

    <p>
      Nothing can burn me now<br>
      I'll be my own lighter<br>
      I feel a spark inside me<br>
      I don't need saving<br>
      No way, no way<br>
      'Cause I'm my own<br>
      I'm my own lighter
    </p>

    <p>
      Nothing can burn me down<br>
      I'm my own<br>
      I'm my own lighter
    </p>
