      Our baby boy<br>
      Was crawling in the living room<br>
      You read a diagnosis<br>
      It said that you'd be dying soon<br>
      It was a sunny day<br>
      Through the window<br>
      There were people going on their ways<br>
      Our little child had the biggest smile<br>
      While we couldn't do nothing but cry
    </p>

    <p>
      How much time do we have left together<br>
      We never know<br>
      All I know is I don't want to be here<br>
      Without your love<br>
      How much time do we have left together<br>
      We never know<br>
      We never know<br>
      Wish we could take it slow
    </p>

    <p>
      A man in white<br>
      With a room full of diplomas<br>
      Trying to get it right<br>
      Could put you under hypnosis<br>
      By saying to give up the fight<br>
      But you were always determined to try
    </p>

    <p>
      How much time do we have left together<br>
      We never know<br>
      All I know is I don't want to be here<br>
      Without your love<br>
      How much time do we have left together<br>
      We never know<br>
      We never know<br>
      But we keep standing strong
    </p>

    <p>
      I admire your power<br>
      I admire your will<br>
      You made me question the world<br>
      You made me question what's real<br>
      I admire your power<br>
      I admire your will<br>
      Your ability to heal
    </p>

    <p>
      I admire your power<br>
      I admire your will<br>
      The way you never gave up<br>
      Until you grew wings<br>
      And you learned how to fly<br>
      Made a loop in the sky<br>
      You landed right into my arms
    </p>

    <p>
      How much time do we have left together<br>
      We never know<br>
      All I know is I don't want to be here<br>
      (Without your love)<br>
      How much time do we have left together<br>
      We never know<br>
      We never know<br>
      Wish we could take it slow
    </p>
